# dictionary2

Using a dictionary I tried to count number of times a name was repeating.

I made a list of repeated names. I sat those names as keys in a dictionary. The keys are uniquue in a dictionary. Then I used a for loop on the list, and counted the times a name is repeated and then assigned it as a value in a dictionary.
